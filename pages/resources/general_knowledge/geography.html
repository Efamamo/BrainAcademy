            <h2>Continents of the World</h2>
            <p>
                The Earth is divided into seven large landmasses known as continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe,
                North America, Oceania (including Australia), and South America. Each continent has unique geographic,
                cultural, and ecological characteristics, such as Africa's diverse ecosystems, Asia's vast population,
                and Antarctica's icy landscape. The division into continents is based on geographical, cultural, and
                historical factors.

            <p>
                Oceans are vast bodies of saltwater that cover about 71% of the Earth's surface. There are five main
                oceans: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic. Oceans play a crucial role in Earth's
                climate and weather systems and are home to a rich diversity of marine life. Seas are smaller than
                oceans and are usually located where the land and ocean meet. Examples include the Mediterranean Sea,
                the Caribbean Sea, and the South China Sea.

                A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity recognized as an independent nation. Each
                country has its own government, borders, and capital city. The capital city is typically the center of
                government and administrative functions, often housing the primary government buildings and officials.
                Examples include Washington, D.C. in the United States, Tokyo in Japan, and Nairobi in Kenya.

                Rivers are natural flowing watercourses, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake, or
                another river. They play a vital role in shaping the landscape, providing water for drinking,
                agriculture, and industry, and supporting diverse ecosystems. Major rivers include the Nile, Amazon, and
                Mississippi. Rivers have been crucial in the development of human civilizations, serving as sources of
                water, food, and transportation routes.

                Earth's surface and are characterized by extreme temperatures and scarce water resources. Despite their
                harsh conditions, deserts are home to specialized flora and fauna adapted to survive with minimal water.

                Climate zones are regions of the world with distinct climate characteristics, primarily determined by
                latitude, altitude, and proximity to water bodies. The major climate zones include tropical, temperate,
                polar, arid, and Mediterranean. Each zone has specific temperature ranges, precipitation patterns, and

                Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that describes the large-scale movement of Earth's lithosphere,
                which is divided into tectonic plates. These plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them
                and interact at their boundaries, causing earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and oceanic
                trench formation. This theory explains the distribution of continents, mountain ranges, and ocean
                basins.

            <h2>Geographic Time Zones</h2>
            <p>
                Geographic time zones are regions of the Earth that have the same standard time. They are determined by
                longitudinal divisions, with each zone roughly covering 15 degrees of longitude. Time zones are
                essential for coordinating time across different regions and are adjusted for daylight saving time in
                some areas.

            <h2>Earth's Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p>
                Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth's outer core. It
                protects the planet from solar radiation and plays a crucial role in navigation. The magnetic field is
                dynamic, with magnetic poles that can shift and even reverse over geological timescales.

            <p>
                Geological formations are naturally occurring layers of rock with distinct characteristics. They are
                studied to understand Earth's history, including the processes of sedimentation, volcanic activity, and
                tectonic movements. Notable formations include the Grand Canyon, the Himalayas, and the Great Barrier
                Reef.

            <p>
                Seafloor mapping involves the study and charting of the ocean floor's topography. Techniques such as
                sonar and satellite imagery are used to create detailed maps of underwater features, including
                mountains, valleys, and plateaus. This information is crucial for navigation, resource exploration, and
                understanding marine geology.

                Freshwater bodies include lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds that contain low concentrations of salt.
                These bodies of water are vital for drinking water, agriculture, and habitat for diverse species. They
                play a critical role in the hydrological cycle, influencing weather patterns and supporting ecosystems.

                Mountain climatology studies the climate patterns and weather conditions specific to mountainous
                regions. Factors such as altitude, topography, and latitude influence temperature, precipitation, and

                Geographic dialects and languages explore the spatial distribution and variation of languages and
                dialects across different regions. It examines how geography influences linguistic diversity, language
